HoloPod
=======

HoloPod is a podcast client for Android 4.0 and up. 
The application follows the Android Design Guide and the focus is to make it as native as possible.

The author is relatively new to Android development and Java, so please be patient. A refactoring of the code is planned during and after feature implementation.

Almost everything :-)
